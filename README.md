📚🤖 AI Book Summarizer — Chat-Based Book Information Assistant

This project is a fully interactive AI-powered Book Summarizer Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to chat with an intelligent interface and retrieve key information about any book simply by typing its name. The system fetches live book data using the Google Books API, providing a smooth and modern book-lookup experience.

✨ What the App Can Do

🔎 Search any book by name using a conversational chat interface

📘 Displays the book cover automatically

📝 Shows the book summary/description

👤 Provides author information

⭐ Displays the book rating (if available)

🎭 Supports queries like Summary, Theme, Characters, and Rating

💬 Chat-style UI that feels natural and user-friendly

⚡ Fast, real-time responses without reloading the page

🧠 How It Works

The app uses a two-step chat flow:

The user enters a book name

The bot asks what information they want (Summary, Theme, Characters, Rating)

Based on the choice, the app fetches relevant details using Google Books API and displays them along with the book cover

The UI is fully dynamic — every message appears in a messenger-like chat bubble for a clean, interactive feel.
